# SDSS Galaxy Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with machine learning techniques and deploying the trained model using a Flask web application.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask

## Project Overview
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Training multiple machine learning models
- Selecting the best-performing model
- Deploying the model using a web interface

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Flask app:
   python app.py
3. Open browser and visit:
   http://127.0.0.1:2222

## Output
The application predicts the galaxy subclass based on input feature values.
